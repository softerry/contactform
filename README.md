# contactform
This project is a simple HTML form that allows users to submit their name and email, select an issue, and provide comments on the issue. The submitted data is processed using PHP and displayed on the second page. The second page allows the user to edit their data, cancel, or submit their request. The submit request is then sent to the MySQL database.


## Project structure
- "index.html": contains the html form.
- "nextpage.php": Displays the users data from the form
- "savadata.php": Contains the database configuration
